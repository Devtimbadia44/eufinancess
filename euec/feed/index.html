We are going to take you through what Elliot discovered and show you how to identify the waves, what they mean, and how to trade with them. As you will find out, it is essential to find the best forex broker in the world for you. That is easy when you read our forex broker reviews. You can then use the Elliot Wave for forex, commodities, stock and CFD trading.</p><p>Alright, where should we start? Back in the old days of the forex market, there was this genius. His name, Ralph Nelson <strong>Elliot</strong>. He was a whiz at finance, and he came up with the Elliott wave theory.</p><p>It is used in all kinds of financial markets, including <strong>CFD trading</strong>. If you are new to the market, before we get into this, you should read the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong> </span></span></a>we provide so you can get the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">best forex broker</span></strong></span></a> in the world for you.</p><p>Back to <strong>Elliot</strong>. He started by analyzing about 75 years’ worth of data from the stock markets, and then he discovered something. In all that apparent chaos of the data, there was some order.</p><p>He was 66 when he hit the analysis jackpot. He had collected enough evidence and was ready to share his findings with the world. He wrote a book called ‘The Wave Principle.’ It changed everything about the market.</p><h2><strong>What Elliot Found</strong></h2><p>According to his findings, the market’s randomness and chaos, actually had repeating cycles. He pointed out that they were emotions of investors caused by influences from outside the market itself. Nowadays, external influences are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, CNBC, ESPN, and others.</p><p><a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/broker-comparison-2020/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-58301 size-full" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/forex-brokers-review.gif" alt="forex brokers review" width="728" height="90" /></a></p><p>The predominant psychological frame of mind at the time of these seemingly random fluctuations was responsible for the order he saw.</p><p>That is how we started using the Elliott wave in forex, stock and <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/cfd-trading-forex-indicators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">CFD trading</span></strong></span></a>, among other markets. He also explained that the downward and upward movements in price as a result of the collective psychology of the market always show up in patterns that repeated themselves.</p><p>These patterns in the upwards and downwards trends are what he called &#8216;Waves.&#8217; That is why we know them as Elliott wave to this day. According to Elliot, if you could correctly identify the repeating patterns in the prices, you could be able to predict if the price would go up or down next.</p><p>That fact is what makes the Elliott wave so appealing and predominant in the forex, stock, and <strong>CFD trading</strong> markets. It is a way to be precise in identifying where the price will most likely reverse in the future.</p><p>Summarily, his Elliott wave system us a method for any trader to catch the bottoms and the tops. In the midst of chaos, this clever man found the answer.</p><p>Pretty impressive, if you ask us.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: <em>Like most geniuses, he named it after himself. Of course, he wouldn’t …who? That is why we call it <strong>The Elliott wave Theory</strong>.</em></p><h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Understanding Fractals Before Elliott Wave</strong></span></h3><p>Before we get into the whole trading with Elliott wave thing, let us look at something significant in this topic. You will have to know what fractals are first. In short, fractals are structures that can be split into parts, each of which is very similar to a copy of the whole thing.</p><p>This is a property that mathematicians call self-similarity. It is the same property that makes snowflakes look like they have smaller copies of themselves within themselves, the more you zoom in. Shells, clouds, and lightning bolts are all fractals.</p><p>So, where do they factor into this? Well, one of the properties of the Elliott waves is that they are fractals. Like clouds and seashells, they can be subdivided into smaller Elliott wave, very similar to the overarching whole.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> <em>Traders who use and are experts in the use of <strong>Elliot Wave</strong> are called <strong>Elliot</strong>ticians.  </em></p><h4><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Understanding Impulse Elliott Wave</strong></span></h4><p>Mr. <strong>Elliot</strong> demonstrated that a trending market moves in a 5-3 wave pattern. We call the first 5-wave pattern, the <strong>impulse waves</strong>, and the last 3-wave pattern, <strong>corrective waves</strong>. In that pattern, waves 1,3 and 5 are motive. That means that they go along the overall trend, and waves 2 and 4 are corrective.</p><p>Do not mix up waves 2 and 4 with the ABC corrective pattern (we will get to that in a while).</p><p>Here’s the 5-wave pattern:</p><p><strong>Does it look confusing? Do not let it intimidate you. So, let&#8217;s color-code each wave to make sure that we can distinguish them.</strong></p><p>There we go. Now it looks beautiful and attractive. Let us describe what happens during each wave to make sure that it sinks in. We will use stocks as an example here. But, you can use it for anything, including trading currency, bonds, commodities and <strong>CFD trading</strong> too.</p><ul><li><strong>Wave 1</strong>&#8211; The stock&#8217;s initial move is up. It&#8217;s the result of the small number of people who, for some reason, feel the price of the stock is cheap enough to buy. The price rises.</li><li><strong>Wave 2</strong>&#8211; Here, the first wave people consider the stock overvalued and take profit. The stock goes down. However, it will not reach the previous low before other people think &#8216;it is cheap enough to buy.</li><li><strong>Wave 3</strong>&#8211; This is the strongest and longest-lasting wave. The stock is now in the eye of the public. Most people know about it now and want to buy it. The price goes much higher this time. It is higher than wave 1.</li><li><strong>Wave 4</strong>&#8211; Traders take profits because now, the stock is overvalued again. This wave is weak because there are a lot of people &#8216;bullish&#8217; on the stock, and they wait to buy &#8216;on the dips.&#8217;</li><li><strong>Wave 5</strong>&#8211; At this point, most people get on the stock. Usually, they are driven by hysteria. At this point, whoever owns that company or the CEO, gets their face on a magazine or something. The traders give the weirdest and sometimes most ridiculous reasons to buy the stock and will flip out if you disagree. At this point, it is at its most overpriced point.</li></ul><p>After that, we get what we call the ABC pattern (it is coming up anytime now).</p><p><strong>Pro Observation</strong>: <em>In the Elliott wave theory, there is always one wave that is longer than the other two. As <strong>Elliot</strong> would put it, one of the three impulse waves (1,3 or 5) is still extended.  </em></p><h5><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Understanding Corrective Waves</strong></span></h5><p>This is the next part of the Elliott wave theory. The 5-wave trends are usually reversed or corrected by the 3-wave trends, which counter them. When tracking the corrective waves, we use letters instead of names to label them.</p><p>Look at this:</p><p>The Elliott wave works on the bearish markets too. It does not just describe uptrends. That is the reason why the 5-3 waves can look like this also:</p><p>According to <strong>Elliot</strong>, there are about 21 corrective patterns (we call them ABC patterns too). They can be simple and gradually get complex. You cannot memorize all of that, and that&#8217;s fine. The thing about Elliott wave is that they are easy to grasp when you know these basics we are teaching you.</p><p>They are all made up of three primary and straightforward formations. Once you understand these formations, you do not have to memorize 21 of them. So, what are the formations we need to know? Well, here they are:</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65905" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Elliott-Wave-tool-that-helps-in-Forex-and-CFD-trading.jpg" alt="elliott wave, elliott wave theory, forex, cfd trading" width="980" height="368" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Elliott-Wave-tool-that-helps-in-Forex-and-CFD-trading.jpg 980w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Elliott-Wave-tool-that-helps-in-Forex-and-CFD-trading-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Elliott-Wave-tool-that-helps-in-Forex-and-CFD-trading-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Elliott-Wave-tool-that-helps-in-Forex-and-CFD-trading-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Formation 1: ZigZag</strong></span></p><p>The zigzags are very steep movements in the price. They go against the dominant trend. Wave B, is the shortest when compared to waves A and C. here is what that looks like:</p><p>The zigzag patterns can happen twice or thrice in a correction. Just like every other wave in the Zigzag pattern, they can be broken up to form the 5-wave.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Formation 2: Flat </strong></span></p><p>The flat formations occur as sideways corrective waves. In the flats, the lengths of these waves are generally equal. The B wave reversing A, move, and the C wave undoes the B wave move.</p><p>Here is what they look like:</p><p>One thing to remember is that the B wave can sometimes extend beyond where the A wave begins. So, it is not always that they are equal.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Formation 3: Triangle</strong></span></p><p>The triangle formations are corrective and are bound by diverging or converging trend lines. The triangles are the product of 5-waves that move in opposition to the trend, in a sideways direction. The triangles can be symmetric, ascending, descending, or expanding.</p><p>If you know all this, you will be fine and able to understand the <strong>Elliot Wave</strong> and how they manifest.</p><h6><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Fractals Part of The Elliott Wave Within an Elliot Wave</strong></span></h6><p>We said that Elliott waves are fractals. They are all made of sub-waves. To make it easy, you need to visualize this so, here’s another pretty picture to help with that process.</p><p>Waves 1,3 and 5 are made up of smaller 5-wave patterns each, and the thing is, they repeat like that TO INFINITY. Like, if you zoomed in, they would just be fractals for the smaller waves and so on, FOREVER.</p><p>To label them quickly, the Elliott wave theory has a series of categories that help you label them from the largest to the smallest. Here is how that breaks down:</p><ul><li><strong>Sub-Minuette</strong>&#8211; Minutes</li><li><strong>Minuette</strong>&#8211; hours</li><li><strong>Minute</strong>&#8211; days</li><li><strong>Minor</strong>&#8211; weeks</li><li><strong>Intermediate</strong>&#8211; ranges from weeks to months</li><li><strong>Primary</strong>&#8211; ranges from a few months to 2 years</li><li><strong>Cycle</strong>&#8211; a year to several years</li><li><strong>Supercycle</strong>&#8211; 40-70 years</li><li><strong>Grand Supercycle</strong>&#8211; several centuries</li></ul><p>Do not think about the cycles too much. The thing is, they go on forever, and you should not really be concerning yourself with that. Just focus on the main ideas, and you will be able to trade with the Elliot Wave for the stock, forex, or CFD trading, with ease.</p><p>The Elliott wave in real life is not shown in perfect lines as you see in our examples. It is a bit more complicated than that, but it should not worry you either. The principles are the same, no matter what it looks like.</p><p>To make sure that you do not get the wrong idea, let’s look at what an Elliot wave looks like in real life when you are doing forex, stock, or CFD trading.</p><p>There it is. So, let&#8217;s learn how you can quickly and accurately identify the waves, so you can apply this knowledge to trade using Elliott wave. Get your surfboard; we are going surfing.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Three Cardinal Rules Governing The Elliott Wave Theory</strong></span></h3><p>Trading with Elliott wave is all about being able to accurately and correctly identify the waves. You need the right eye and three rules, which you can never break. They will help you label waves.</p><p>Here they are:</p><ol><li>Wave 3 can never be the shortest impulse wave</li><li>Wave 2 can never go beyond the beginning of wave 1</li><li>Wave 4 can never cross in the same price are that wave 1 is in</li></ol><p>There it is. If you know these, you can identify the parts of the wave and, in that way, know what you are looking at.</p><p>And now, the Elliott wave trading guidelines. Unlike the cardinal rules, these are not absolute:</p><ol><li>Wave 5 does not move beyond the end of wave 3. We call this truncation</li><li>Wave 5 often goes beyond the trend line drawn from wave 3, parallel to a trend line that connects the start of wave three and wave 5.</li><li>Wave 3 tends to be long, sharp and extended.</li><li>Wave 2 and 4, often bounce off levels indicate by Fibonacci retracements.</li></ol><p>That&#8217;s all you need to know about that part. Let&#8217;s look at the scenarios now.</p><h4><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Way You Do Stock, Forex, Commodities and CFD trading With The Elliott Wave</strong></span></h4><p>Here are the things you should be able to do:</p><ul><li>Know how to pinpoint where waves 3 and 5 start. They are the trend continuation waves in the 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave formation.</li><li>Know how to detect when the pullbacks start to happen after waves 1 and 3. They are essentially Waves 2 and 4. It is advisable not to trade against the trend. So, these waves are not for when to trade but for when not to trade.</li><li>Know how to determine the end of the impulse wave setting and the start of the ABC corrective wave.</li></ul><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <em>Do not forget that the trend continuation of waves 1,3 and 5 within the impulse waves, have 5 component subwaves and the retracement waves of 2 and 4, usually have 3 component waves. </em></p><p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></span></p><p>The best way to learn how to spot the Elliott wave is by trading using them. We recommend that you start trading on demo accounts that will show you what you need to know about what the real data of the market looks like.</p><p>The best way to find demos to use is to read our forex broker reviews to find the best forex broker in the world for you. If you can do that, they will provide you with a demo account that you can then use to train and learn.</p><p>When you see what they look like in real life, you will have no trouble employing them in forex, commodities, and CFD trading, among other markets.</p><p>It is that simple. Happy training, everybody.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/the-elliott-wave-tool-and-how-you-can-trade-with-it/">The Elliott Wave Tool and How You Can Trade with It</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com">Top Forex Broker&#039;s Reviews  | Free Forex Education</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/the-elliott-wave-tool-and-how-you-can-trade-with-it/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Learn How to Use Kumo as a Support and Resistance Tool</title><link>https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/learn-how-to-use-kumo-as-a-support-and-resistance-tool/</link> <comments>https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/learn-how-to-use-kumo-as-a-support-and-resistance-tool/#respond</comments> <dc:creator><![CDATA[TopFXBrokersReview]]></dc:creator> <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 11:17:39 +0000</pubDate> <category><![CDATA[Forex Fundamental]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex analysis]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex broker]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex brokers review]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex education]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Forex market]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Forex News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Kumo]]></category> <category><![CDATA[support and resistance]]></category> <category><![CDATA[support resistance]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/?p=65879</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>We are going to talk about the Kumo Cloud from the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo trading system.

On the popular <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/mt4-and-mt5-trading-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MT4 program</strong></span></a>, the Kumo Cloud is listed as an oscillator.</p><p>You will be able to use it to find support and resistance, and also see if the market is overbought or oversold.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the visuals on this system might be intimidating for a beginner. However, there is a treasure trove of material that explains how useful the tool can be and how each of the components interact to form the Ichimoku trading system.</p><p><a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/broker-comparison-2020/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-58301 size-full" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/forex-brokers-review.gif" alt="forex brokers review" width="728" height="90" /></a></p><p>Before getting into details and whatnot, let us summarize the system in a few short paragraphs. After that, we will learn how you can use Kumo Cloud to get the support and resistance areas of the market.</p><ul><li><strong>Kumo Cloud</strong>&#8211; These are the areas where the Ichimoku trading system shows the support and resistance areas. They are derived from the previous pricing data. Here, the borders of a UP cloud are called Senkou Spans A and B. You will get alerts when the candlesticks exit the Kumo Cloud, other lines enter or pass the designated region or when the cloud’s color changes.</li><li><strong>Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen</strong>&#8211; These lines work the same way that moving averages do. They are calculated from the previous lows and highs over the 9 and 26 periods. TheGreen line is called Tenkan- se and is the quicker of these two. Its intersections are instrumental trading signals, and the slope is the measurement of momentum.</li><li><strong>Chinkou-span</strong>&#8211; This line is the measurement of <strong>market sentiment</strong> and is based on the current closing prices, but moved backward 26 time periods. The position of the Chinkou-span relative to pricing data shows if buyers or sellers are dominating the action in the market. The cloud&#8217;s position may show resistance if it comes into play here.</li></ul><p>Now that we have acquired that out of the way let&#8217;s get into the rest of this. Keep in mind, you are only as good as your broker. That is why we have the forex broker reviews section to let you choose the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>best forex broker</strong></a> in the world for you.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Advantage You Get From Kumo Cloud’s Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Trading System</strong></span></h3><p>If you are a trader who is used to their favorite indicators, using the Ichimoku system with its integrated 4 or 5 indicators, working in tandem, might seem hard. Should you let go of what you know in favor of this new system?</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Is it worth going through an entire learning-curve all over again?</span></strong></p><p>Well, the answer to that question actually comes down to your personality as an individual. Are you willing to accept new ideas with ease, even when you have not tested them or gained confidence in how you can apply them?</p><p>Many traders chose the route that you may have guessed by now. They just use the Kumo Cloud in isolation, to detect the <strong>support resistance</strong> areas. It is a way of solidifying the interpretation that they make, concerning market behavior.</p><p>Trading with support resistance levels is a popular method that is preferred by many traders. That is why we are going to teach you how to do it so that you too, can benefit from what is offered by the <strong>Kumo Cloud oscillator</strong>.</p><h4><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>How Kumo Cloud Finds Support and Resistance For Traders</strong></span></h4><p>Before getting into the specifics of how the Kumo Cloud works in finding the support and resistance levels, we should probably talk about the elements of support and resistance trading, as a method.</p><p>If you can learn these elements, the whole thing becomes easier to understand. So, let’s start with that.</p><ul><li><strong>The Important Elements of Support and Resistance in Forex Trading</strong></li></ul><p>To understand the Kumo’s use in support and resistance indication, we need to start here with one of the elements that we call role reversal.</p><ul><li>In a role reversal, the switching of roles of the support and resistance points happens. The cause is a pullback or returns movement of the price action after it has broken through this crucial level. Therefore, a broken support level turns into a new resistance level, and a broken resistance level turns into a new support level.</li><li>The second element is essential too. It is the fact that repeated testing of the critical area of support and resistance, which does not break these areas, usually makes them more durable. That tells you, more pressure from traders is needed, to break these areas.</li></ul><p>As you will find out, the whole concept of support and resistance is much easier to get when it is visualized in a chart. Now that you know the crucial elements here, we can move on to the Kumo shapes that decide the support and resistance strength.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65889" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/support-and-resistance.jpg" alt="support and resistance, support resistance" width="980" height="368" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/support-and-resistance.jpg 980w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/support-and-resistance-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/support-and-resistance-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/support-and-resistance-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p><h5><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>How Kumo Cloud Shows Support and Resistance Strength</strong></span></h5><p>The shape of the Kumo is what indicates to a trader, how strong the support and resistance will be. So, how do you use the shape of the Kumo to do that?</p><p>When you look at it, the <strong>Kumo</strong> is bound by two lines that we call Senkou Span lines A and B. They delineate the Kumo and make it easy for you to distinguish it from the rest of the Ichimoku indicator.</p><p>The Kumo can appear to be flat or bulky. You will have to check and see which shape it takes and if it is forming a top or bottom.</p><p>After you identify the tops and bottoms, you can use the trend line tool to draw on your performance. This way, you can trace a line across the Senkou Span A to Span B, for flat top and flat bottom respectively.</p><p>With the proper trace, a trader can detect instantly, where the price bounces off support or when the resistance rejects it. In this instance, the support and resistance are delineated by the borders of the Kumo Cloud.</p><p>With this action, you can know when the price goes into reversal mode. With that information, accurate entries with limit orders are easy to make.</p><h6><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>What You Need To Note About the Kumo Cloud</strong></span></h6><p>Being able to realize when the price is going to bounce off <strong>support resistance</strong> is the reason why you need to have this one. With it, you can tell when it will break through the trendline and act in role reversal. These are the tenets that are used by traders who want to trade successfully.</p><p>You can use them too and be able to get the best support and resistance information for your use. We use the principle of the breakout here. For the price to be considered as having broken a support/resistance area, the price bar or candles must have closed beyond that specific area, usually, by the use of a time filter or price filter.</p><ul><li>When doing technical analysis, the time filter you use is a double candle close. That means the price has to close below support or above resistance with two successive candles before we can say that a breakout in price has happened.</li><li>The second way to confirm when a price breakout has happened is the price filter. With this, the candle that closes above the resistance or below the support to reveal a breakout must close with a penetration of 3% in long term charts and 1% in short term charts.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>You Wonder</strong>: <em>What is 1% and 3% penetration, and how do we calculate them?</em></span></p><p>Let’s do that one. Let’s start with the 3% penetration math. The percentage references the extent to which the price moves beyond the support and resistance point. We express it as a percentage of the length of the candle.</p><p>Let&#8217;s say that a candle breaks the red support line closed at a price of 8073.50. The candle high could be at 8625.90. The whole candle moves from the high to the closing price, and the calculation is as follows:</p><p>8625.9 – 8073.5 = 552.4</p><p>So, we get the difference first. The support line is at 8289.98 in this case. The distance from the support line to the closing price is, therefore:</p><p>8289.98 &#8211; 8073.5= 216.48.</p><p>To get the penetration percentage, we do the calculation as follows:</p> [216.48/552.4] X 100% = 39%</p><p>So, the penetration here is 39%, and that is more than the 3% needed to say that a price breakout has happened. With this, you will be able to know when to trade a bounce situation with the Kumo top/bottom or see a breakout or a role reversal situation.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></span> As you learn all this, you should get a broker who has all the tools you will need to trade properly. For that, you will need the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best forex broker</strong></span></span></a> in the world, and our <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">forex broker reviews</span></span></strong></a> are a good place to start.</p><p>Essential Things To Remember About the Ichimoku System</p><ol><li>The Ichimoku cloud has five lines. Two of them compose a cloud where the difference is shaded, between the two.</li><li>The lines show a nine-period average, 26-period average and an average of those two averages. In addition to that, they also have a 52-period average and a lagging line for the closing price.</li><li>The cloud here is a crucial part of the indicator as a whole. When the price is below the cloud, we consider that a downtrend and when the price is above the cloud, we call that an uptrend.</li><li>The trend signals we have mentioned are more reliable if the cloud moves in the same direction as the price. For instance, during an uptrend, the top of the cloud moves up, or the bottom of it moved down, during a downtrend.</li></ol><p>It is all right there.</p><p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></span></p><p>There are not many people who use the <strong>Kumo tool</strong> for <strong>support and resistance</strong> indication. It is understandable because many of them start with the most common kind.

Few of them actually practice it in real life. Remember that a market is a risky place.</p><p>Without a minimization of the adverse effects, there is an excellent chance that you could end up losing money that you should not have lost.</p><p>We talk about <strong>money management in the forex </strong>a lot because we know that it can seem like a burden of sorts. It is not a pleasant activity. It takes work, and few people like to do it. You are always in constant alert mode. You have to monitor your positions and make some necessary losses.</p><p>No one likes to do that. However, you will find that <strong>money management</strong> is profitable in the long run. You will end up being sharper and better, and after a while, it won’t seem so much like work.</p><p>Let us show you how hard it can be to recover from losses, just to prove the point we want to make about money management.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65866" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table.jpg" alt="trading golden roles" width="1113" height="185" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table.jpg 1113w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-300x50.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-1024x170.jpg 1024w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-768x128.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-600x100.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1113px) 100vw, 1113px" /></p><p>As you can see, it is not easy. To return to the original equity value, a trader would need to earn 100% on their capital. That is a feat accomplished by less than 1% of all the traders in the world. Plus, that would just be a way for a trader to breakeven on an account that has a 50% loss.</p><p>When the loss goes up to 75%, you would need to quadruple your account, and that is just to bring the account back to the original equity value.</p><p><em>The point here is that <strong>money management in forex</strong> is essential, and you should not ignore it at all.</em></p><h4><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Golden Rules, With Which To Do Money Management</strong></span></h4><p>If you are new to this, consider looking through our <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a> to find the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">best forex broker</span></strong></span></a> in the world for you. Let’s start learning the rules, shall we:</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1. Make a Smart Deposit</strong></span></p><p>Many times, you have no doubt heard that a deposit of $50, $100 or $200 is enough to get you started. Yeah, do not be naïve. Only a handful of traders have the patience to have fun with small profits. The rest of the traders want to set the risks very high and then expect to get a tenfold increase in the initial deposit that they make.</p><p>This is the perfect recipe for failure and loss beyond the scale of anything that you can imagine. <strong>Money management in forex </strong>is about never assuming you won’t lose. Make a smart deposit and ensure that you start small and then increase your stake over time. Make an intelligent deposit by estimating something manageable when you start.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2. Do Not Over-Leverage Your Deposit</strong></span></p><p>If you were thinking about starting with a small deposit and then using a high leverage to make more money all at once, banish the thought. That is not what could happen. The leverage recommended by most, for an average, is 1:100.</p><p>Over-leveraging or overloading the deposit is a mistake that many rookies make. It might seem like a good idea, but you need to take the market in small bites. If you try to hurry your way to the top, the chances are, you will never get there. <strong>Money management in forex</strong> is about restraint sometimes.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3. Do Not Lose Track of Your Trades</strong></span></p><p>Often, newbies in the forex markets rush to make too many trades that are all open at the same time. You will not only be placing pressure on yourself but will also be ensuring that you fail when the pressure gets to you and you fumble around.</p><p>If you have a single fixed loss, you could manage what you lose, instead of having many of them open. If the scenario becomes terrible for you and you start losing money, it could happen in a path that you will not be able to control or even manage properly.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>4. Always Consider Risk Levels</strong></span></p><p>You might think that your analyses are all good. However, no matter how good the analysis seems, you should always take care not to raise the lot too high. The aim might be to gain the maximum profit here but, you could just as quickly lose a lot of it.</p><p>The size preferred when it comes to risk levels is about 5% if the deposit you make. However, you will do well to limit it to 3% or 2%, just to stay safe. As you will find out, there is a lot to lose, if you do not take care not to raise your risk too high.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>5. Stop-Loss is A Must, Not a Recommendation</strong></span></p><p>We do not have a law prohibiting you from not using the stop-loss. However, we must insist that you have it. <strong>Money management</strong> is a lot easier if you have this incorporated into your trades.</p><p>You would be a fool to think that you can trade the forex market if you do not have this. You will surely deplete your deposit if you do not use the stop loss. Unexpected news happens and natural disasters too. Something can happen at any time to make you lose all your money.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65868" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-1.jpg" alt="forex trading" width="980" height="368" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-1.jpg 980w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-1-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-1-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-1-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p><p>Always protect the trades you make.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>6. Have The Smart Profit/Loss Ratio</strong></span></p><p>If you see a trade where the ratio of profits to losses is less than 1:2, avoid it. We recommend that you go for the trades where the ratio is 1:3. This means that a single profitable trade is capable of covering the loss from 3 trades that fail.</p><p>If you can cover your bases like this, you should be fine. <strong>Money management in forex</strong> can be easy if you want it to be easy. Try to gain as much as possible during any trade. Then, use that trade to over other trades if they all come out well, good for you.</p><p>If you get burned on three of them, you should be able to say you broke even, because of the one that did not burn out, covered the ones that did.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>7. Do not Struggle At Trailing Stops</strong></span></p><p>This is a method of trading that is available to all traders. It is better than breakeven, and it lets you fixate the profit at a preferable rate. In the case of an unrehearsed sideways trend, for example, you will want this in your corner.</p><p><strong>Money management in forex</strong> works out well when you trade like this. It is also easy on the mind when you trade like this. Do not get caught unawares when anything unexpected happens. You can protect yourself in such a case.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>8. When You Are Supposed To Sleep, Go To Sleep</strong></span></p><p>Your biological clock is a factor when it comes to trading, and you will need to consider it too in you want to make it in the market. <strong>Money management</strong> depends on your retaining the cognitive abilities that make you good at spotting trends and avoiding mistakes that could costs you money.</p><p>Your brain works less effectively when you do not get enough sleep. That is the reason why you need plenty of rest. Do not overwork yourself. It is unlikely that you can monitor all your trades when your brain is not working at peak performance.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>9. Forex is not a Casino</strong></span></p><p>Do not ever forget that. This market is not about hitting the jackpot. Collect the small profits you get and then do it all over again. With time, you will get better and be able to net more. A successful trader prefers the hens he gets today, rather than the eggs tomorrow promises.</p><p>You can gain a considerable profit in small parts. Do not look to get the hen and the eggs today. If it happens, let it be some kind of lucky break. If you enter the forex market looking for huge profits all at once, you will fail. <strong>Money management in forex</strong> is also about practicing the virtues of patience and restraint.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>10. Pick Appropriate Trading Instruments</strong></span></p><p>If you have an account balance of like $300, why would you trade gold? The thing about being appropriate in your choice of instruments to trade is based on knowing what is wiser. There is a high chance you will drain your deposit before you even know what is happening.</p><p>You have to make sure that your skills are top-notch before you start experimenting with assets that are reserved for the pros. Not that you cannot do it. You can. It&#8217;s just that everything is in a tier and if you are a low-level trader, learn your level and master it first.</p><h5><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>PRO TIP: Avoid Looking for The Big One</strong></span></h5><p>If you have never heard of George Soros, you will. He is a legend in the forex markets, known for being the man who &#8216;broke the Bank of England&#8217; and netted himself a cool $1 Billion in a day.</p><p>The fantasy has endured of traders looking for the ‘big one.’  As we said, this is a fantasy, and you will regret ever investing time and money into looking for something as mythical as the billion-dollar payday Soros had.</p><p>The reality for almost all of the traders who look for the big payday is that they toss out the golden rules of <strong>money management in forex</strong> and they end up with nothing.</p><p>It is not extraordinary to hear stories of people who invested and netted themselves a lot of money throughout 3, 4 or even 5 years and lost it all in a single day because they were looking for a big one.</p><p>Control your risk and avoid the fate that befalls the fools who think they are the geniuses of the market.  Money management does not have to be that hard.</p><p>If you are looking for the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best forex broker</strong></span></span></a> in the world, read our <strong><a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">forex broker reviews</span></span></a>. </strong></p><h6><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></span></h6><p>There is a lot to learn when it comes to <strong>money management</strong>. However, the one thing that we cannot forget is that we should always be smart about trades. As explained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_D._Schwager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Schwager</a> in his famous book &#8216;Market Wizards&#8217;, you should never risk more than 1% of your total equity on trade.</p><p>By risking just 1% on a trade, it makes you indifferent to any individual trade. You could lose 15 times in a row, and you would still have 85% of your equity left.</p><p><strong>Money management in forex</strong> is not that hard. It all comes down to consistency and discipline. Like a child who learns not to touch hot things by touching them and getting burned, you could learn the hard way.</p><p>Or, you could just take these golden rules and practice them.

Learn To Enjoy The Trading - Forex Trading Tips</strong></span></h2><p>To enjoy trading, you need to learn how to make the best trading decisions. These <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> will be of no use if you do not know how to stay calm. It is not just about calmness. You will need to know when you are ready to enter and exit the market. I love the work you do. The best way to go about that is to have strategies that work and to be mindful.</p><h3><strong>2. Keep Your Mind Clear</strong></h3><p>Calmness and objectivity are at the top of what constitutes these stock and forex trading tips. Your emotions cannot control you when you trade. If you let them, the losses will come fast, and they will hit hard. There is a saying; scared money doesn’t make money.</p><h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3. Start with Manageable Steps</strong></span></h4><p>The <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> are no use if you have not done this the right way. You have to start somewhere. By that, we mean you need to use demo accounts. They will help you develop your strategy so that when you start trading for real, you know what to do and what not to do.</p><h5><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>4. Use Money Carefully - Forex Trading Tips</strong></span></h5><p>For every position, you take, have three times as much money left in the account, as you have in the trade. If you manage the trade volume properly, you will avoid falling out of the <strong>stock</strong> and forex market because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_Call" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">margin calls</a>.</p><h6><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>5. Profit Comes From Strategy and Not Will</strong></span></h6><p>Just because you want profits, does not mean you will get them. It might seem like the most obvious of the <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong>, but most people make assumptions. Profits come from having a strategy that works. Emotions and feelings are not necessary. Facts are the lifeblood here.</p><h3><strong>6. Consistency Is Key - Forex Trading Tips</strong></h3><p>Study the general market, use demo accounts to learn, develop a strategy, test it repeatedly until you are sure that you can be consistent. Then, and only then, can you start in the real markets? While there, make sure that you never do anything out of the blue. Stick to a plan that works.</p><h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>7. Do Not Rush To Crowded Trades</strong></span></h4><p>As a professional trader, one of the essential <strong>stock</strong>s and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> is to never rush to crowded trades. Pros always look in the other direction, away from the hype. There is always an opportunity to be had. You need to know where to look and position yourself right.</p><h5><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>8. Take Breaks From Trading - Forex Trading Tips</strong></span></h5><p>When you have not taken a position that you need to watch like a hawk, never let trading get monotonous. Do not let it be all you do. Always take breaks to make sure that you do not overwork yourself. It will allow you to have different perspectives and avoid mental exhaustion, which leads to mistakes.</p><h6><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>9. Trust Yourself</strong></span></h6><p>If you have studied the market, done all your homework, you can trust your judgment completely. Unless you are using copy or social trading, you got this on your own. The <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> won’t help when you are easily distracted by information that contradicts your own.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>10. Teach Yourself How To Find New Opportunities</strong></span></h3><p>Pro traders know very early on that one of the best things they can ever learn from the numerous <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong>, is to look for opportunities. Learn how to make transactions, track the market data and find opportunities for trades that win.</p><h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>11. Pick an Instrument/Asset and Trade Well</strong></span></h4><p>Do not try and hit two birds with one stone. Even the pros know that it is a bad idea to try and make multiple trades. Pick an instrument or asset and follow the <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> to trade it well. Study it, learn everything, and then execute the trades correctly.</p><h5><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>12. Apply Information Given At The Opening of a Trading Session</strong></span></h5><p>The volatility of an asset can let you know how to trade it on the day the session opens, and even the next day. The <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> encourage you to get information at the start of the session because the direction of the market is much clearer and you can decide to go long or short, based on that.</p><h6><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>13. Trend Is a Friend - Forex Trading Tips</strong></span></h6><p>Of all the <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong>, this one ensures that you can stay profitable. If a position you chose is not showing profitability, do not then proceed to fund it and wait for the price to change according to how you envisioned it. Follow the market trader and trends.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>14. Strive to Close Unprofitable Positions</strong></span></p><p>The timely closing of positions is one of the best <strong>stock</strong>s and <strong>forex trading tips</strong>. You will need to be able to make sure that you get out before you lose. Discipline is the name of the game here, and you will find that the orders placed well, is the key to being profitable. Do not forget that the point here is not to avoid mistakes but to know when you have made one and do everything in your power to rectify it.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>15. Do Not Be Afraid to Admit Mistakes</strong></span></p><p>Just so you know, even the professionals make mistakes. They are professionals because they learn one fundamental lesson very early on. As a <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tip</strong>, it might not seem like much. However, admitting mistakes, when you make them, is the best way to learn from them.</p><p>If you think you are always right, you will most likely repeat the mistake and lose money again. That is the thing about the market. Your feelings about what you did, do not matter. You will need to make sure that you always know you made a mistake, admit it and then never repeat it if you can help it.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>16. Do Not Rush to Close a Position</strong></span></p><p>If you see a profitable trade and you enter a position, do not rush to close it. You cannot sell a position just because you are doing things for profit’s sake. You should always make sure that you have a reasonable motive to do so.</p><p>Plan to exit a trade in advance, so you do not have to do it on the fly. Make sure that you know when you will get out even before you enter the position.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>17. Do Not Let Losses Throw You Off-Balance</strong></span></p><p>Keeping a clear head is not easy if you do not know how to take a loss. The best way to avoid this all together would be to avoid losses themselves. However, the reality of the <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> is that you will lose something at some point.</p><p>Do not let losses chip away at your pride or get you into a panic mode every time. If you do, the consequences would likely be far more significant the next time. Learning to accept losses is a great way to stay objective.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>18. Learn How To Place Stop Losses</strong></span></p><p>Losses are part of trading. Just because one of our <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> is about accepting failure, does not mean that you just lie back and take losses all the time. There is a way to minimize them. One of those ways is by learning how to place stop losses.</p><p>It will help you become disciplined and master cutting losses. Figure out where to place the stop loss before you start the trade to avoid making expensive mistakes.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>19. Enter The Market Mindfully</strong></span></p><p>Do not just wake up, fire up the software, and then start trading there and then. The <strong>stock</strong> and <strong>forex trading tips</strong> from pros, indicate that you need to enter the market when a trend appears. Never enter the market by guessing the directions. You have charts; you have strategies, and all the resources needed to make the right decision. Do not set all that aside and just start doing things recklessly.</p><p>When you do not have a good plan and facts, you will be vulnerable when you enter the market, and your losses could increase exponentially, the more you do it.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>20. Trade With Facts But Listen to Rumors</strong></span></p><p>Okay, that sounds odd, doesn't it? Well, rumors are not totally without some truth in them. Just to be clear, we are not saying you should trade by rumors. That would be a stupid thing to do. The rumors could sometimes point to a trend that has not yet shown up.</p><p>If you look at the facts and they seem to indicate that the rumors are correct, then, you can consider following that rumor and see where it leads. However, the last say is with the charts and the facts and what you can see and not what you heard from someone somewhere.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>21. Take Advice From Kenny Rogers</strong></span></p><p>Ever listened to 'The Gambler' song by Kenny Rogers? Well, he gives some good advice. Granted, it's about playing cards, but it applies to the forex and stock market too. The forex trading tips we have given may not be of much use to you if you are greedy.</p><p>In that song, there is a lyric that goes “You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away and know when to run…”</p><p>What we are saying is that, if a trade works in your favor and you have some dough coming your way, never wait for the market to swallow it back up again. Take your money and run. Close that trade and wait for something else to crop up so you can trade again.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></span></p><p>You have learned a lot about stock and forex trading tips. This is probably what you have been missing. If you saw something that you were not doing that was listed here, go ahead and start. Incorporate as much discipline as possible into what you do, and everything will fall into place gradually.</p><p>As for other issues, you can read our education sections, and for the <strong>best forex broker in the world</strong> who will suit your needs, you should read our <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a>.</p><p>The information that you know is what makes a difference in the forex and <strong>stock</strong> market.

Crypto trading is not that different from <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forex trading</strong></span></span></a>. However, the nuances that exist in forex markets are not the same as the ones you will find when trading crypto.</p><p>It seems like it might be hard to abandon the lucrative world of crypto trading so that you can be in the world of forex. However, the facts should show that the sustainability and endurance of the forex world, offer some options the world of crypto does not have.</p><p>If you are new and seriously considering getting into the world of forex, there is something else you should know. A broker is essential. For that reason, we think you should read our <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a> to find the best forex broker in the world that will suit you.</p><p>Transitioning from crypto trading to forex will be challenging. However, we think you can do it. There is a way to make the method smoother and less painful. This guide will give you an outline of how you can move from crypto trading to forex.</p><p>The transition can be well-budgeted, less nerve-wracking, and take up less time.</p><p><a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/broker-comparison-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-58301 size-full" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/forex-brokers-review.gif" alt="forex brokers review" width="728" height="90" /></a></p><p><strong><em>Let’s get into it.</em></strong></p><h2><strong>Here’s How You Switch from Crypto trading to Forex</strong></h2><p>The facts you are about to learn are very illuminating and essential. We know that it took you time and a lot of effort to understand<strong> crypto</strong>. For that reason, we are going to assume that you know a thing or two about the power of education when it comes to any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial markets</a>.</p><p>The charts you have mastered, the crypto exchanges, and other fundamentals of trading assets, will apply here. You will have a easier time transitioning than someone who is starting from 'zero forex knowledge.'</p><h3><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Understand That The Forex Market Is a Two-Way Street </span></strong></h3><p><strong>Crypto trading</strong> has an absolute straightforwardness to it. In the crypto markets, you usually buy the currencies at a low price and then sell them when the price goes up. That is a simple way to make money, and we know that crypto trading does not require much in the form of nuanced financial knowledge.</p><p>However, the forex market is not that linear. It is a two-way path in the sense that a trader has to start by opening a long or short position. You can learn more about how this happens by going through our forex education sections.</p><p>There, you will also be able to find <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a> and, hopefully, the <strong>best forex broker in the world</strong> for you.</p><p>As we were saying, you will have to learn how to predict what could happen, using charts and the information that they offer. You need to know what happens every moment so that you can get profits from the currency pair you trade.</p><p>Depending on your position, you can make money from both the falling and rising of prices. It is not an easy thing for beginners to do.</p><p>For that reason, we have all manners of software that shorten the calculations and just show you what is happening in real-time. The crypto trading world does not need something so complex to operate well.</p><p>With these platforms, you will be able to see how the currency pairs traded works. Unlike crypto trading, you will have so many variables in the forex markets. But, you can look at everything that is happening on a graph and, with time, learn how to spot when to move in and when to exit.</p><p>The forex market is also a zero-sum kind of market where the money you lose, is gained by someone somewhere else.</p><h4><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Select At Least Three Currency Pairs for Trading</span></strong></h4><p>Unlike <strong>crypto trading</strong>, where you focus on just one currency like <strong>BTC</strong> (Bitcoin) or <strong>ETH</strong> (Ethereum), the forex traders rarely, if ever, trade only one asset. The minimum number of assets you need to trade as a forex trader is three.</p><p>As a beginner, you will want to stick with the traditional currency pairs. They are USD/JPY, BGP/USD, and EUR/USD. It is good to learn all you can about the significant pairs so that you can transition from trading just three currency pairs to more.</p><p>The three mentioned there are called the Golden Trio because they are the movers and shakers of the market. They are the dominant currencies that witness the most action.</p><p>We measure the power of a currency in the forex markets, based on how much volume it can move in a day or week or month. After you learn the less volatile currency pairs, then you can move on to the big three.</p><p>Where in crypto trading, you had to focus on one and didn't have to trade it against others while focusing on many other variables, here you have to look at more data.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64718" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading.jpg" alt="forex trading" width="980" height="368" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading.jpg 980w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-trading-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p><h5><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do Not Start Trading Without A Clear and Proven Strategy</span></strong></h5><p>There is a lot to learn. Listen up crypto traders: never go in without a strategy. So, where do you get one of those? Well, the strategies are developed by the traders over time.</p><p>As you will see in our blog about education, the strategies are developed when you use demo accounts. Crypto trading may not have demo accounts, but forex does. You will receive fake virtual funds, real market data, and a platform.</p><p>You will then proceed to apply all the things you have learned up to that point, to come up with a technique that works for you.</p><p>Strategy is how you avoid making mistakes that can cost you money. Strategy is repeatedly tweaked to make sure that it works and that there is consistency. Without a strategy that delivers consistent results, you will not be able to turn a profit quickly.</p><h6><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Start with Momentum Strategies</span></strong></h6><p>No doubt, crypto has changes in prices where a trend starts and then ends at some point. Well, in forex, we have the same thing. You will need to make sure that you learn about momentum and the strategies that you can apply there.</p><p>As you have no doubt done in the crypto trading world, this one too will need you to seek out a way to trade the currency pairs that are most compatible with the knowledge you have. Never guess.</p><ul><li>So, what you need to pursue the aggressive uptrends like this:</li><li>First, you identify the momentum point.</li><li>Then you test and use the practical strategies that you develop to trade the momentum identified.</li><li>Practice risk minimization to make sure that you know when you will exit before you open the position.</li></ul><p>As you will find out, unlike in the crypto trading world, we stress very much about the need to have a strategy and a way to minimize risk because losing money is easier than you think.</p><h3><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Never Risk Your Entire Deposit</span></strong></h3><p>Where in crypto trading, you would just wait for the value to go up so you can sell, forex requires more finessing than that. You never put all the money you have at stake when you start. The risk in forex is much higher than in crypto trading.</p><p>That is why we always begin by telling new students that they need to learn as much as they can, so they do not make mistakes like this. When you have gained enough experience, we still do not recommend putting everything at stake.</p><p>Usually, we recommend a 3% of your total deposit, for every trade, to begin with. Crypto trading risks are just not the same as what you will encounter here. For that reason, always practice caution.</p><p>Pro Tip- We stress on education a lot because we know for a fact that no one can make it in the forex world by themselves. Always learn before you try to get into the forex markets.</p><h4><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A Comparison of Crypto trading and Forex Trading</span></strong></h4><p>Before you transition, you need to know that the two financial markets are different. To understand how various, we are going to break them down into five major defining features. At the end of this illuminating comparison, you will see just how crypto trading differs from forex.</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><strong>Stability</strong></li></ul><p>Crypto trading has a reputation for being unexpected and prone to experiencing huge uptrends and downtrends. The stats from BTC from the past few years attest to the volatility of crypto trading markets.</p><p>Forex is volatile as well but much stable with consistent uptrends and downtrends. There might be the occasional crash, such as witnessed in the middle of a pandemic like the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. However, in regular times, the stability is noticeable.</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><strong>Liquidity</strong></li></ul><p>The crypto trading market is less liquid. The volume traded is around 53+ billion USD. Most of it is BTC, with a whopping 67%.</p><p>The crypto trading market pales in comparison when put up against the astonishing volume of 5 trillion, traded by the forex market. The most significant share goes to EUR, USD, GBP, JPY, CHF, AUD, and CAD, in that order.</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><strong>Hours of Trade</strong></li></ul><p>The crypto trading markets never go to sleep. They are always open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p>The international forex markets are open for trading 24 hours a day for five days a week. They also have major trading sessions in New York, London, Sydney, and Tokyo.</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><strong>Middlemen Fee</strong></li></ul><p>In the crypto trading world, there is no need for intermediaries because everything is peer-to-peer. However, to reduce the risk, traders use the crypto trading exchanges like Binance. To use such services, there is a fee to pay.</p><p>In the forex markets, you cannot skip the middleman. To find the best broker in the world, read our forex broker reviews. There is no peer-to-peer trade like in crypto trading. Here, you will pay a small fee for services, partnerships, or consultation and support to operate.</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><strong>Regulation</strong></li></ul><p>Because of the decentralization, it is hard to regulate <strong>crypto trading</strong>. They have serious issues because of how new the technology is and the fact that there is no clear legislation for it yet.</p><p>The <strong>forex market</strong> is more secure because of just how regulated everything is. Just like in crypto trading, some choose not to get regulated. It is expedient to stay away from them if they cannot prove regulation. The reason is that, if there is a problem, you will not get any help because there is no governing body you can report to.</p><h5><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why Forex Has More Education That Crypto trading</strong></span></h5><p>When you get started, you will need to know that you have to be well educated in what the market is all about. That is why we have an education program that will show you how to get started and take you from the beginning, all the way to the end.</p><p>The topics are divided into definitions, mathematics, strategy, all you need to know about platforms and other essentials.</p><p>You will find out that most of the traders who flame out, are the ones who do not bother to learn anything useful before they get started.</p><p>You may see a lot of advertisements that tell you how easy it is to make it in the world of forex if you knew just one secret. They are not valid. This is not like <strong>crypto trading</strong>. What you know is directly related to how much money you can make.</p><p>You did not have brokers in the world of crypto trading, but you cannot do without them here. To find the <strong>best forex broker in the world</strong>, you will need to read our forex broker reviews.</p><h6><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In Conclusion</span></strong></h6><p>Is transitioning from <strong>crypto trading</strong> to <strong>forex</strong> easy? Not at all. Can it be smooth? Absolutely. You just need to know how to do it, and we'd like to think that at this point, you have some idea of what you will need to do to get there smoothly.</p><p>As we mentioned several times, in terms of brokers, you will need to get some of the best forex broker in the world. For that, you will need to read our <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a> where we make comparisons too. The information there will point you in the right direction.</p><p>There is a lot to learn before you can honestly say that you now understand what the forex has to offer. The work that goes into understanding crypto trading is pretty much the same amount of work you will need to put into this.</p><p>Diversification is great. We support any effort made to invest in more than one place, just to make sure that if you break eggs in crypto, you have something to hold you up somewhere else.</p><p>Happy learning.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/crypto-trading/">What You Should Know About Switching from Crypto to Forex</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com">Top Forex Broker&#039;s Reviews  | Free Forex Education</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/crypto-trading/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Essential Forex and CFD Trading Indicators You Should Know About</title><link>https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/cfd-trading-forex-indicators/</link> <comments>https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/cfd-trading-forex-indicators/#respond</comments> <dc:creator><![CDATA[TopFXBrokersReview]]></dc:creator> <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 10:32:07 +0000</pubDate> <category><![CDATA[Forex Fundamental]]></category> <category><![CDATA[cfd trading]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex analysis]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex brokers]]></category> <category><![CDATA[forex indicators]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Forex learning]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Forex market]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Forex News]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/?p=64545</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>Useful Trading Indicatros for Forex and CFD Trading Welcome to CFD trading, where we will discuss forex indicators and how you can use them for your own trading strategies.

When you start using them, they will be set by default on some levels. There is a chance that you could pick out some custom indicators for use in select scenarios, to make sure that you have extra-accurate data.</p><p>In discussing the CFD trading and the forex indicators, we will look at the best native indicators which come with the MT4 platform and also look at some from external sources that you can add.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64575" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/trading-indicators.jpg" alt="trading indicators" width="980" height="368" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/trading-indicators.jpg 980w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/trading-indicators-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/trading-indicators-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/trading-indicators-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p><h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Forex Indicators You Should Use for Forex and CFD Trading</strong></span></h4><p>Let’s get to it. Here, in no particular order of importance or otherwise, are the forex indicators that you need to know about for your forex and <strong>CFD trading</strong>.</p><p><strong>1. Stochastics</strong></p><p>Among forex indicators, we have those that we call oscillators. This is one of them. As a forex trader, you can use it in two ways:</p><ul><li>It can be a way for you to spot when there are price extremes (like when the market is overbought or oversold)</li><li>You can also use it to detect the divergences.</li></ul><p>These are the two main things that the oscillator will show you. As forex indicators go, this is a beneficial function that you cannot do without. When forex and CFD trading, you will need to know when long-term and short-term price reversals will happen.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_oscillator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">stochastics</span></a> in tandem with other forex indicators and, in that way, always be ahead of the curve. Price reversals always happen in the market. That is the reason why you will need this one among your forex indicators toolbox.</p><p>When a trend has run to almost the end of its course, you will need to know when the next price movement is coming.</p><p>Oscillators are the leading forex indicators when it comes to detecting that kind of thing. It does not matter if you are CFD trading or currency trading, you will always need to know when the next move is coming and how it is going to look like.</p><p>In our other articles, we have talked about leading indicators. Stochastics are leading forex indicators, which show trends before they happen. In forex and CFD trading, you will always need to know what pattern to expect next.</p><p>You will not have a hard time detecting the overbought and the oversold areas when you have stochastics forex indicators. It pairs very well with the Fibonacci retracement tool. You can use them to recognize the re-entries into the long-term trend after price retracement.</p><p>Last but not least, the divergence and extremes in prices, are usually accurate and can be converted into very profitable trends.</p><h5><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2. The Market Profile Indicator</strong></span></h5><p>This is one of those forex indicators used in forex and CFD trading. It can show you on the charts, where there is a maximum offer volume or maximum bid, for a currency pair or a CFD asset.</p><p>With the ability to see the price at which the institutional traders are buying and selling an asset in substantial volumes, you can then know at which price you need to be buying or selling an asset in CFD trading or forex.</p><p>This will ensure that you do not get stuck making lifeless trades that do not seem to go anywhere.</p><p>There are many sources of the market profile indicator. Some of them you do not need to pay for, but others require you to pay. The forex indicators are useful, and if you feel like paying will get you somewhere, then, by all means, buy one.</p><p>Sometimes, this forex indicator is called a volume profile indicator because you can see the volume profile for any asset (in the case of CFD trading) at any given time when the markets are live.</p><p>The advantage you get when using this market profile forex indicator when compared to other volume indicators is that it can plot volume on the Y-axis of price and not on the X-axis.</p><p>The reason why this is so important in forex and CFD trading is so that you have better volume information at every specific price level.</p><p>The movements and activities are all plotted out as things happen, and not after they have happened.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64576" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-indicators.jpg" alt="forex indicators" width="980" height="368" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-indicators.jpg 980w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-indicators-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-indicators-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forex-indicators-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p><h6><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3. The Auto Pivot Point Calculator</strong></span></h6><p>This is another excellent forex indicator that you will need when doing forex and CFD trading. With it, you can derive pivot points on the chart from the previous day on closing, low, and high prices. Instead of crunching the numbers yourself (math is hard), you can just use this tool, and it will do that work for you automatically.</p><p>There are two versions of this forex indicator. One of them calculates the weekly pivot points and the common one that we are used to calculates the daily pivot points. We are going to focus on the one that calculates the daily pivot points.</p><p>When you are doing day trading on forex or CFD trading, you can be able to see the daily price levels and be able to find the support and resistance. Typically, we have three resistance levels and three support levels and then the central pivot.</p><p>Even though they are named like this, the reality is that the pivot levels above the market price can function as resistance, and the ones below the market price can work as the support.</p><p>You can use them individually and separate from each other, or you can combine them with different <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">forex tools</span></strong></span></a> and indicators so that they produce entry and exit signals for your forex and CFD trading activities.</p><p>With a forex indicator like this, you can be very exact in what you do as they will show you where the price activity for intraday trading starts and where it stops. Using the pivot points, you can comfortably choose 3-5 setups on currency pairs and get at least 20 pips on each of them on a trading day.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>4. Fibonacci Tools</strong></span></h3><p>Do not ever fail to use the Fibonacci tools in forex and CFD trading. You will deny yourself one of the most significant opportunities to make money in the world of forex. Fibonacci tools base their function on a sequence of numbers discovered and described by a mathematician named Fibonacci, from several centuries ago.</p><p>These numbers alert us to retracement and continuation points, which then correspond with wave sequences that you find in price actions, according to the definitions provided by Charles Dow and Elliot.</p><p>With the use of Fibonacci numbers, it is easy to trade the retracements, set prices to target re-entry for trades, and the Elliot sequences as well.</p><p>With the Fibonacci forex indicator, you can draw retracements at 23.6%, 38.3%, 50%, 61.8% and 78.6%. This will include swing lows to swing highs and the reverse when in a downtrend. As a trader doing forex and CFD trading, you will be able to have a clear idea where a retracement from a low or high that has happened, will end.</p><p>With this, you know where the re-entry opportunity will be on the long-term trend.</p><p>The Fibonacci expansion tool is something you can use to define price targets from re-entry trades that have a clear definition from the Fibonacci retracement tool. With something like this, you can avoid all the times when you give profits back to the market by leaving your retracement trades at the best time.</p><h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Other Forex Indicators You Should Know About</strong></span></h2><p>The ones we have listed do not even begin to cover what you should know.

Forex traders recognize this software immediately because it dominates the market. If you are planning on becoming an FX trader, you will find it hard not to use MT4 or MT5.</p><p>The MT4 story starts back in the year 2000 when it was nothing but a simple charting package. It evolved over the years from a charting tool to become the only platform traders use.</p><p>As you will see in our forex broker reviews, the best forex broker is one who offers multiple platforms. MT4 and MT5 are always staples. Since MT4 first hit the market, there have been many upgrades, which have made it even better.</p><p>Back in the year 2000, when Online Retail Trading was in its infancy, <strong>MT4</strong> was just a charting tool. Even in 2005, there was not much online retail trading going on.</p><p>Just as with any other product, the advantage of being the first to arrive on the market, cannot be understated. That is what happened with MT4. Familiarity with the product is also a key factor because all you need to do is get the demo or try out the live version for a limited amount of time.</p><p><a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/broker-comparison-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-58301 size-full" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/forex-brokers-review.gif" alt="forex brokers review" width="728" height="90" /></a></p><p><em><strong>Before we continue, let us settle something first: MT4 vs. MT5? Which one should you go for?</strong></em></p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>MT4 vs. MT5: Battle of The MetaTrader Versions</strong></span></h2><p>Ladies and gentlemen, understand one thing first. The MT5 is regarded as the sister of the reliable and trusted MT4. There are some differences between the two. The most crucial difference which forex traders should note is that they have different market functionality.</p><p>To be honest, the platforms are very similar in almost every way. The backend of the platform is what’s different. The way that <strong>MT5</strong> is coded is what makes it easier to work with than the predecessor.</p><p>Now, you are probably an average FX trader who is not looking to tinker with the coding of the programs to change algorithms and whatnot. For that reason, this should not be a concern. There is not much difference between the two. They’re practically the same.</p><p>Both <strong>MT4</strong> and <strong>MT5</strong> come with the same indicators, the same execution time, and there is nothing about aesthetics that could clue you in on any noticeable visual differences.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>What is The Big Deal with MT5, Then?</strong></span></h3><p>Well, the company behind these fantastic platforms is trying to push the <strong>forex traders</strong> over to the new younger version, for no other reason other than to ‘upgrade.’ It is not much of an upgrade because the only thing about <strong>MT5</strong> that was different when it came out was that it has more assets to offer, like stocks and whatnot.</p><p>However, recent upgrades were made on MT4 to include the same things. That is why people do want to move to MT5. It is a hassle trying to download something new, install it and then just start using it with the same indicators and features that you already have.</p><p>Most of the FX traders are comfortable with what they have and the big deal…well, there is no big deal here? You can use either of them. They are the same.</p><p>Plus, some people have tweaked the programming on <strong>MT4</strong> to make their own EAs. They do not want to move to <strong>MT5</strong>, learn a new language so that they can redo their work all over again.</p><p>Alright, let's get into what brought use here, finding out why MT4 and MT5 are so prevalent than most of their counterparts, among many forex traders.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59340" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MT5.jpg" alt="MT4, MT5" width="980" height="368" srcset="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MT5.jpg 980w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MT5-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MT5-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MT5-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p><h4><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Here’s Why MT4 and MT5 are So Popular Among FX Traders</strong></span></h4><p>We are going to look at the things that most <strong>forex traders</strong> cite when asked why they prefer these platforms.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1. MT4 Is Easy To Use</strong></span></p><p>Why? Because they came first, people have only ever known MT4. Most of the market’s FX traders went into the game just as MT4 was beginning to take hold. It was the first thing they found. Anything new looks difficult and different.</p><p>That aside, even though it came first, the platform is easy to use. Trading forex or CFDs can be challenging for any forex trader. Why should you make it any harder than it needs to be when you can use MT4 or MT5 and reap the benefits of having most of the tasks handled.</p><p>There is always a learning curve that FX traders need to get past so that they can be able to use these platforms effectively. However, with MT4 and MT5, specifically, there is no need to worry because the learning curve is not that steep.</p><p>The processes are made easy, have shortcuts, and are easy to remember. The interface is simple so that you do not get lost in a host of features. The <strong>MT4</strong> and <strong>MT5</strong> platforms have made it so that forex traders do not need many steps to make an order.</p><p><strong>For example:</strong></p><ul><li>If you want to use MT4 and MT5 to make an order, all you need to do is use the F9 button on your keyboard or just click on the New Order button the interface, or you can just click on Tools and go to New Order.</li><li>What’s more, as an FX trader, you can even create a new order by using the open chart by right-clicking on the chart and then clicking on Trading and New Order.</li></ul><p>Think about that for a second. What FX trader wouldn't want to have four smooth pathways like that, just for creating a NEW ORDER?</p><p>By being easy to use, they have created a platform that can be used for many purposes, and that is why <strong>MT4</strong> and <strong>MT5</strong> are going to be popular for years to come. The <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best forex brokers</strong></span></span></a> on our <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a> have both platforms for you to use when you sign up.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2. The Multi-Purpose Nature of MT4 and MT5</strong></span></p><p>There are many functions that you can execute just by having these platforms. They are all features essential when it comes to trading. Take this example;</p><p>There is a News Bar on the platform where you can get access to all the new that moves the market and other events, as they happen in real-time. Some of the news has an immediate impact, and you can just glance at it, see what's about to happen, and position yourself correctly to be on the right side of the market when it moves.</p><p>Here’s another example of how that is very beneficial:</p><ul><li>When Nigel Farage’s party in the UK election said that they were not going to contest the December 12 elections, the GBP pairs rapidly moved around. Without the news bar, there is no way you could have known immediately what was causing such a shift.</li></ul><p>The news is not the only function you will find when using the MT4 and MT5 platforms. The forex traders need to access things like the interactive charts that you can use to study the market and analyze the available assets before you get in to trade.</p><p>The <strong>MT4</strong> and <strong>MT5</strong> platforms have the Market and Code Base tab on the interface window that allows any FX trade on the platform to access the MQL community directly. There, you can buy things like:</p><ul><li>Scripts</li><li>Indicators</li><li>Expert advisors</li></ul><p>There is no need to go anywhere else to pay for what you buy. You can simply pay for what you purchase using the money that is in your account. If that is not convenient for a forex trader, then what is?</p><p>Let's say you go on the CodeBase tab, and you find the robot that matched exactly what you would like. You click on it, or just go to the Market tab and lick to be connected to the market where you take a look at the product and then pay for it right there and then.</p><p>The other significant functions that most of the <strong>forex traders</strong> like about <strong>MT4</strong> and <strong>MT5</strong> include:</p><ul><li>They can have access to the economic calendar, which shows an FX trader all the significant events and news about the economy, from other countries.</li><li>Funds transference can happen between multiple accounts, all connected to the same trader.</li><li>You can access the community chat function because it is embedded into the platform.</li><li>You can fill only just a portion of your order if you want to.</li><li>If you want to avoid slippage, there is a ‘fill or kill’ function that can help you with that.</li></ul><p>With features like this, you will be able to enjoy all the superior services that you might not be able to find with other retail <strong>forex traders</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/go/fxvipsignals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-58547 size-full" src="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vip-signals.gif" alt="" width="728" height="90" /></a></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3. All Your FX trader and CFD Needs In One Place</strong></span></p><p>Typically, you would have to use a different platform for CFDs and a different one for your forex needs. Now, all FX traders can use MT4 and MT5 for everything without having to switch to any other software.</p><p>You can think of this as your access to the entire market catalog. If you need to trade currencies, they got you. If you want to trade CFDs on commodities, stocks, and indices, you can do that here with no issues at all.</p><p>Any trending or moving market is available to you as a forex trader when you use <strong>MT4</strong> or <strong>MT5</strong>. You never have to miss anything. You can go from one market to the next, with a few clicks.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>4. Automated Trading Using Robots</strong></span></p><p>If you read the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a>, and you find that the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>best forex broker</strong></span></span></a> you choose has MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5, then you can be guaranteed of Experts Advisors and robot trading. This feature is the icing on the MT4 and MT5 cake.</p><p>These platforms were the first to use virtual forex robots that open and close positions automatically. Even better is the fact that you can change the code because it is built right into the interface to design your forex robot and optimize it to be just how you would like it to be.</p><p>Forex robots are so popular now that classes are held worldwide with record attendances to help people learn how to tweak the program so that it helps them become better <strong>FX trader</strong>s.</p><p><strong>5. You Can Have Many Versions</strong></p><p>Presently, the <strong>MT4</strong> and <strong>MT5</strong> platforms are available on desktop, the web-based version (called WebTrader), and the generic platform for mobile phones. The MetaTrader 4 has something called Multitrader for when a forex trader wants to manage more than one account at a go.</p><p>With each of the mobile platforms, you will find that there is one designed for use on iOS systems and one for Android devices. You can use the platform for both smartphones and tablets.</p><p>With people being so attached to mobile devices, it makes sense that they should be able to use the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms while on the go. It is incredible what you can do as a forex trader with this platform.</p><p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>To Wrap Up…</strong></span></p><p>You can trade <strong>MT4</strong> and <strong>MT5</strong> with ease today. They are both available on many of the best forex broker websites. You will find the <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/best-forex-broker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best forex brokers</strong></span></span></a> by reading through our <a href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/forex-brokers-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forex broker reviews</strong></span></span></a>.</p><p>Many of the forex traders are familiar with the product, and that is why they mostly use it and not other products like <a href="https://www.iress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRESS</a> and cTrader. As you will come to find out, there are not many different options that are as good as this one for an FX trader.</p><p>There is a lot to talk about when it comes to platforms, but we think you get it now. The platform is one of the best for a reason. Just test it out during the demo account trials, and you will see what we mean.</p><p>Even with the advent of other platforms that could become competitors, the world of forex traders remains firmly rooted in the use of MT4 and who can blame them. Try it out for yourself and see what they have to offer.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/mt4-and-mt5-trading-platform/">Why MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) are So Popular Platform</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com">Top Forex Broker&#039;s Reviews  | Free Forex Education</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://www.topfxbrokersreview.com/mt4-and-mt5-trading-platform/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
